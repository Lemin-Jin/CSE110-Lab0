I am a third year Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics major student in UCSD. As a programmer, this is my first time to include github into my programming workflow. I am familiar with **C/C++, java, python**. But I have not used any scripting langugage like CSS/PHP/javascript. I am looking forward to learn more about these scripting language in this course.
